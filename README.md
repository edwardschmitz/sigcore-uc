# SigCore UC – Universal Controller

**Status:**    In Development  
**Version:**   revA (prototype phase)  
**Runs on:**   Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) with a .NET 8-based server and a C#/WPF Control Panel for Windows.


SigCore UC is a modular, high-precision universal I/O controller designed for engineers, developers, and integrators working in automation, control systems, and experimentation.

It supports a broad range of analog, digital, and current-loop signals, and is built to be both powerful and transparent—from PCB to Python.
